As the world is becoming more advanced day by day and it is trend of people to have an automated machines. Therefore our goal is to build an automated mixing machine. In this mixing machine we can mix three dry solid ingredients (of 50 grams each). Input is given through a switch. As soon as we on the switch 3 lids of the containers open and allow the ingredients to fall in the mixing area. In the mixing container they get thoroughly mixed and hence we will get the required mixed output. The process gets completed within 1 minute. It indicates the user the process is completed when the LED bulb starts blinking. This machine is used in bakeries and sweet making industries.
